                    In our 10 years of friendship we experienced hundreds of beautiful moments together. The sad fact is, that most of these great stories are forgotten and overwritten by the amazing chaos of life -
                    lost in the millions of pictures and texts we exchange every day. But how was it really? How did it feel? Thatâ€™s why we created audienz.app where you can tell all your personal stories with the most intimate and true medium of all time: your own voice.</p>
